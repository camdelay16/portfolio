  bio: "Hello! I'm Cameron. I'm a Full Stack Developer passionate about building clean, user-friendly applications.  When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying long walks on the beach with my two dogs. My background includes a successful career in executive administration, where I honed skills in project management, problem-solving, and communication. Now, I'm channeling that experience and my passion for technology into creating impactful web applications. Proficient in JavaScript and Python, along with front-end and back-end technologies including React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Flask, and Django. Experienced with database technologies like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.  I'm also actively learning Rust and exploring its potential in blockchain development, an area I'm particularly interested in.  I'm eager to leverage these transferable skills and my growing technical expertise to contribute to a challenging and innovative web development team. Currently seeking opportunities as a Full-Stack Developer. University of Massachusetts, Amherst (Dual Degree: Communication & Psychology). I'm always looking to learn new technologies and expand my skill set.",

        "This project, originally developed as my Unit 3 project at General Assembly, is a full-stack web application designed to connect users with local events and deals.  I collaborated with a team of four developers on the initial version, which allowed users to post events and deals in their area, and RSVP to events or claim deals. Since then, I've significantly enhanced the application by refactoring and expanding both the front-end and back-end code, creating a more cohesive and feature-rich user experience.  Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this project demonstrates proficiency in building full-stack applications with complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and RESTful API design.  Key technologies used include React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and CSS3.",
